### Why do I need to tailor my coffee recipe?

Well, strictly speaking I suppose you don't! But for maximally delicious coffee, some tweaking always makes for a tastier cup.

Broadly speaking, there are two basic [[brew methods]]: **percolation** and **immersion**. For _percolation_ methods, you will grind your coffee slightly finer and use slightly less of it. For _immersion_ methods, you'll grind slightly coarser and use slightly more. These are both on average&mdash;each specific brew method has its own needs.

### What is a good coffee recipe to start with?

Different people have different preferences when it comes to coffee. Some like it stronger than others; some like more of it than others. You really have to experiment to find something you like&mdash;I can't just give you the exact ratio that will taste best to you!

But here's a good place to start: many coffee guides recommend brewing at a **1:16 ratio.** That means however much coffee you're brewing with, use 16x that much water. Here's some examples of how that stacks up with real-world measurements (remember that we're [[measuring coffee by weight]]):

|         | Coffee | Water (g) | Water (oz) |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| 1 Cup\* | 7.5g   | 120g      | ~4 oz      |
| 2 Cups  | 15g    | 240g      | ~8 oz      |
| 3 Cups  | 22.5   | 360g      | ~12 oz     |
| 4 Cups  | 30g    | 480g      | ~16 oz     |

\* One "cup" of coffee equates to ~4 fluid oz.

Remember that **immersion** [[brew methods]] generally need a bit more coffee than percolation. If you're using an immersion method, try switching to a 1:15 ratio instead.
