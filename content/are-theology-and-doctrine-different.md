title: Are "Theology" and "Doctrine" Different?

Yes. Many Doctrines (like [[Calvinism]] or [[Doctrine of the Trinity]]) are simply collections of multiple [[positions]] within various branches of **Theology**. Having the one word makes it easier to refer to each of the parts together as a unit.

Here's some (oversimplified) examples:

- [[Calvinism]]
  - [[Theology Proper]]: [[God]] is [perfectly sovereign](/sovereignty-of-god)<!-- [[Sovereignty of God]] --> over everything in creation and [completely free](/freedom-of-god)<!-- [[Freedom of God]] --> to manifest [his glory](/the-glory-of-god)<!-- [[The Glory of God]] --> as he sees fit.
  - [[Hamartiology]]: Mankind is [totally depraved](/total-depravity)<!-- [[Total Depravity]] -->, meaning we can't do anything good, even [trust God](/faith)<!-- [[Faith]] -->.
  - [[Soteriology]]: [[God]] chooses to save some sinners, and [he freely chooses whom he will save](/unconditional-election)<!-- [[Unconditional Election]] -->. [Not everyone](/limited-atonement)<!-- [[Limited Atonement]] --> is covered by [Jesus' atoning sacrifice](/the-crucifixion)<!-- [[The Crucifixion]] -->, but those who are will [certainly believe](/irresistable-grace)<!-- [[Irresistable Grace]] --> and be [saved to the very end](/perseverence-of-the-saints)<!-- [[Perseverence of the Saints]] -->.
- [[Protestantism]]
  - [[Ecclesiology]]: [[God]] has made those whom he saves into a [[Priesthood of All Believers]], none of whom is qualitatively superior to any other. [[Jesus Christ]] alone is the head of [his church](/the-church)<!-- [[The Church]] -->, not any human pope or ruling caste of human priests.
