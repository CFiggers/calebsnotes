Most Category Theorists (especially the ones that care a lot about practical uses for Category Theory, like [[Logic]] and [[Programming]]) use diagrams to represent **Categories** under discussion. Here's an example:

![]()

This diagram has three (3) basic elements:

- [[Dots]] (in Category Theory these are also called "Objects")
- [[Arrows]] (also called "Morphisms")
- [[Labels]] (i.e., the "A", "B", "C" and "f", "g", "h")

Category Theory Diagrams have a special rule: [[Every Category Theory Diagram is only partially complete.]]
