### What is Spaced Repetition Software?

**Spaced Repetition Software** includes any computer program designed to assist with the [[Spaced Repetition]] method of learning and memorization. Using **Spaced Repetition Software** is an instance of the broader methodology that [[Andy Matsuchak]] calls "[[Programmable Attention]]."

I use **Spaced Repetition Software** for memorizing [[Hebrew]] and [[Greek]] vocabulary words and grammar flashcards.

Examples of **Spaced Repetition Software** include:

- [[Anki]]
- [[Cerego]]
- [[NeuraCache]]
- [[RemNote]]
- [[Quizlet]]

Some applications and programs are not solely focused on [[Spaced Repetition]], but have features or optional add-ins that support using that method. [[Roam Research]] is an example of this (having both rudamentary native features and expanded options with the [[Roam Toolkit]] browser extension.)
