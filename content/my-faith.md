### What is my Faith?

(For a quick and dirty summary, see [[The Apostles' Creed]].)

"[[Faith]]" is a technical term meaning "belief that changes what you think, feel, and do." Here is a short explanation of mine.

### Christianity and the Bible

I am a [[Christian]]. I believe that [[God]] is real. I believe he [[created]] the entire [[Universe]].

I believe that the Christian scriptures (aka, "[[The Bible]]") contain [[God's actual writings]]. I believe [[God]] wants humans to know about and believe [[the message]] that is in [[his book]].

[[The Bible]] teaches that all humans are born with a terminal disease. (All except three, that is&mdash;but two of those three were Patients 0 and 1, respectively. Their names were Adam and Eve.) The disease is not genetic. But it is hereditary, and there is no natural cure.

This illness has a **100% mortality rate**, and YOU have it, because your parents had it. The presenting symptom of this disease: _wanting to stay sick._

This disease is called [[Sin]].

### The Problem: Sin

[[The Bible]] teaches that [[Sin]] is hating the [[God]] who made you and wanting to [[replace him]]&mdash;usually with [yourself](/self-idolatry)<!-- [[Self-Idolatry]] --> somehow. But sinful hearts aren't picky&mdash;any replacement will do.

This is _irrational_&mdash;that means it defies [[Reason]]. It is like a leaf hating its own tree. Or a flower seething with hatred toward the sun. We need [[God]] to exist at all—but, irrationally, we HATE him.

[[God]] is really, really [[good]]. He didn't have to [[make]] anything. But he did, and he made it wonderful. You are an incredible work of art. [[God]] made you.

[[God]] does not deserve our hate. He deserves our love. We are in the wrong.

[[The Bible]] teaches that [[God]] would uphold [[Justice]] if he [[infinitely punished]] Sinners (i.e. us) forever. He is infinitely [[good]], making offense against him infinitely [[bad]].

But [[God]] _delights_ in being merciful. He knows that [[Sin]] is a sickness, and he _loves_ to heal people who are sick.

This presents a quandary. [[Justice]] is clear: those who hate and [[replace God]] deserve to _get what they want_—which is to be cut off from the source of all [[good]] and spend eternity growing more and more [dead](/hell), like a flower that hates the sun.

Can [[God]] heal sinners AND uphold [[Justice]]?

The shocking resolution to this quandary is "Yes!"&mdash;but not in a way anyone expected.

### The Solution: Jesus

[[Jesus Christ]] was a human man who lived 2,000 years ago in Israel. He was (and is) [[God's own Son]], who is himself [[God]]. [[God the Father]] sent him from [[Heaven]] to make a way for Sinners (that's us) to be [[saved]] from [[Sin]] and [[Death]].

[[The Bible]] teaches that [[Jesus]] took full punishment for [[Sin]] on himself to satisfy [[God]]'s [[Justice]]. And he lived a perfect, [[Sin]]-less life to fulfill the righteousness that we failed to live up to. He [[died on a Roman cross]], betrayed by his own people, naked, ashamed, and alone.

Just like [[God]] does not deserve our hatred, [[Jesus]] did not deserve to be punished for [[Sin]]. But he willingly and knowingly took that punishment in order to pay the rightful penalty of [[Sin]] in the place of the Sinners (that's us) who actually earned it.

On the third day after his death, [[God]] raised [[Jesus]] back to life. The [[Bible]]'s word for this is "[[Resurrection]]." This proved [[Jesus]]' innocence, confirmed his [[Identity]] as [[God]], and declared him with power to be [[who he claimed to be]]. [[Jesus]] ascended into [[Heaven]] and took the ruling seat over the entire [[Universe]]. He's still there today.

[[The Bible]] teaches that [[Jesus]] then sent [[The Holy Spirit]], who is also himself [[God]], to grant [[Faith]] to Sinners (that's us), to live in their hearts, and through [[Faith]] to make them [[Identify]] with [[Jesus]]. [[Identity]] with [[Jesus]] means that his punishment for [[Sin]] (which he didn't commit) covers their debt, and his righteous life [[becomes theirs too]].

This is a spiritual [[Resurrection]] exactly as [[Miraculous]] as [[Jesus]]' own rising from the dead. In fact, our spiritual [[Resurrection]] is, in a real sense, a direct continuation of [[Jesus]]' physical one. The two events are deeply connected to one another.

### The Message of the Gospel

[[The Bible]] teaches that Sinners&mdash;that means anyone who has this terminal disease which makes them hate [[God]] and _want_ to never get better&mdash;have exactly **one hope** to not [[die]] eternally for good:

[[The Bible]] teaches that YOU need to believe that [[Jesus]] was telling the truth. You need to admit your [[Sin]], reject it, and [[throw it away]]. You need to ask [[God]] to give you [[Faith]] and make your life united to [[Jesus]]' life. You need to submit to [[Jesus]] as your King. If you do, then his payment covers your [[crimes]], you are no longer [[God]]'s enemy, and you will [[live forever]] in [[Heaven]] with him (this is a [[very, very good]] way to spend eternity). This [[Gospel]] (which means "good news") is the **one hope** for _all people everywhere_.

Life is very short. And it only ends one of two ways: either you [[die]], or [[Jesus]] comes back first. Either way, the window of opportunity to accept this hope&mdash;that is, to believe in this [[Gospel]] and be [[saved]] from [[Sin]] and [[Death]]&mdash;is closing awfully soon. After that point, it will be too late. [[Death]] forever will be all that's left.

Make no mistake: [[God]] will serve [[Justice]] ultimately. Even foolish humans don't just let murderers go free. Neither will [[God]] just forget the wrong we do, to him and to each other.

Either [[Jesus]]' life and sacrificial death is covering your [[Sin]], or [[Sin]] is still on you and you are in real [danger](/hell). Time _will_ tell. I hope you won't wait!
