### What is Programming?

**Programming** is writing structured instruction sets for computers to follow in order to accomplish some calculation or task.

I am not a professional programmer. But I do it for fun, and I think it is a good way to learn how to think carefully about how ideas interact with each other.

I have _some_ experience with these languages (some more than others, and none too terribly much):

- [[Apex]]
- [[Clojure]]
- [[Haskell]]
- [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[JavaScript]]
- [[Python]]
- [[SQL]]/[[SOQL]]
- [[Visualforce]]
