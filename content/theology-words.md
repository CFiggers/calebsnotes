At the end of the day, "label" words like "[[Justification]]" are **made up.** [[Theologians]] have written in dozens of languages for thousands of years, and there is no single "correct" set of terms to use when talking about theological ideas.

**This is ok!** [[The Bible]]'s words were [inspired](/inspiration)<!-- [[Inspiration]] --> in their original form by [[The Holy Spirit]], so we can trust those ones to be much more reliable. But [[All truth is God's truth]], no matter what terms it is expressed in. [Merely human](/creaturely-limitation)<!-- [[Creaturely Limitation]] --> words that try to synthesize and apply [biblical truth](/revelation)<!-- [[Revelation]] -->, like any words humans write without [God's special help](/inspiration)<!-- [[Inspiration]] -->, are limited and imperfect.

Not everyone separates "Theology" into the same categories I have on the [[Theology]] page. That's ok. Not everyone would agree with my super-brief summaries of [[Calvinism]] and [[Protestantism]] on the "[[Are "Theology" and "Doctrine" Different?]]" page. That's also ok. Theology is a [merely human](/creaturely-limitation)<!-- [[Creaturely Limitation]] --> endeavor to understand [[God]] and his [revealed truth](/revelation)<!-- [[Revelation]] --> more fully. It isn't possible for [merely human](/creaturely-limitation)<!-- [[Creaturely Limitation]] --> beings like us to do that perfectly. [But it's still worth working on!](/-anything-worth-doing-is-worth-doing-badly)<!-- [["Anything worth doing is worth doing badly."]] --> [[Imperfect things can still be useful and valuable.]]

At the end of the day, it is [[God]] himself, by [[The Holy Spirit]], who [makes it possible for us to understand anything at all](/illumination)<!-- [[Illumination]] -->. Imperfect words, ideas, and understanding (which we will always have, [forever](/heaven)<!-- [[Heaven]] -->!) aren't enough to stop God from helping us know true truth about him, [if that's what he is pleased to do](/illumination)<!-- [[Illumination]] -->.
