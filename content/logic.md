### What is Logic?

The word "**Philosophy**" comes from [[Greek]]:

- λογική ("logike") = "logic"

The English word is directly imported from the Ancient Greek term, and it retains more or less the same meaning. The Greek word "λογική" itself derives from another Greek term, "λόγος" ("logos"), which means "word" or "reasoning."

**Logic** is the study of consistent reasoning, meaning, and understanding cause and effect.

- [[Formal Logic]]

Positions held or rejected under the study of pure **Logic** can affect the following topics in [[Applied Philosophy]]:

- [[Mathematics]]
- [[Philosophy of Science]]
- [[Rhetoric]]
