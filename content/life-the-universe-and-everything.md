title: Life, the Universe, and Everything

**"Life, the Universe, and Everything"** is the title of the third [book](/books)<!-- [[Books]] --> in the classic sarcastic-comedic science fiction "trilogy" [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]], written by [[Douglas Adams]]. ("Trilogy" is in sarcasm quotes because Adams, a contrarian and comedian to the very end, wrote _four_ books in the series, and yet deliberately continued calling it a "trilogy.")

I use the phrase in a variety of contexts as a light-hearted alternative to the terms "[[Worldview]]" or "Life Philosophy"&mdash;both of which could be summarized: "Everything one considers important to think about and have [views](/position)<!-- [[Position]] --> on, especially as regards reality, [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and the meaning of life."
