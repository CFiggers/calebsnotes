### What is Human Enterprise?

The words "**Human**" and "**Enterprise**" both come from [[Latin]] (through [[French]]):

- _humanus_ = "Of or relating to mankind"
- _inter_ + _prehend≈ç_ = "What is undertaken"

"**Human Enterprise**" is therefore an extremely broad umbrella term (and intentionally so) comprising all of the various things that mankind attempts to do.

Some (but by no means all!) of the sub-categories that I will treat under **Human Enterprise** (as opposed to [[Academic Disciplines]] and [[The Sciences]]) are:

- [[Aeronautics]]
- [[Business]]
- [[Engineering]]
- [[Finance]]
- [[Government]]
- [[Industry]]
- [[Journalism]]
- [[Medicine]]
- [[Warfare]]
