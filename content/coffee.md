### What is Coffee?

You know what coffee is (probably). ðŸ˜‰

I enjoy several things about coffee. First, I like the taste. Second, I enjoy the process of making coffee. It is a skill-based challenge with immediate, objective feedback on whether you did a good job. Third (and it's a distant third), it's nice to have a caffeine boost from time to time.

### How do I make better coffee at home?

I'm not an expert on making coffee, by any stretch. And I haven't spent the money to get really high-end equipment, so there's a limit on how good I can even make it. But here are the basics, as I understand them, for making delicious coffee, in your kitchen, at home:

- [[Get Good Coffee]]
- [[Grind Your Own Coffee Beans]]
- [[Measure Your Coffee by Weight]]
- [[Source Good Water for Your Coffee]]
- [[Tailor Your Coffee Recipe to Your Brew Method]]
- [[Find a Brew Method that You Like]]
- [[What to Spend Money On for Better Coffee]]
- [[Drink Your Coffee Black]]
