### What are Programming Paradigms?

A **Programming Paradigm** is a (somewhat-arbitrary) classification that programmers use to [[Label]] major differences of approach when [[solving problems]] when [[Programming]].

Most (if not all) major [[Programming Languages]] in use today combine elements from multiple different **Programming Paradigms** in their design and implementation. Since a **Programming Paradim** is essentially just a loose description of the approach that a programmer chooses when solving problems, it is often possible to solve the same problem using multiple paradims even within the same language. That said, most languages give extra attention to facilitating a particular paradigmatic approach more strongly than others. This leads certain languages (or individual language features) to become associated with certain paradigms. As an example, [[Haskell]] is strongly associated with the [[Functional Programming Paradigm]].

At the end of the day, a **Programming Paradigm** is a style of [[Thinking]] that applies to [[Programming]] tasks (and sometimes other tasks too).

The most common **Programming Paradigms** in use today are:

- [[Imperative Programming Paradigm]]
- [[Procedural Programming Paradigm]]
- [[Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm]]
- [[Functional Programming Paradigm]]
- [[Literate Programming Paradigm]]
