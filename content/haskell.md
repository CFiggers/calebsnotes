### What is Haskell?

**Haskell** is a general-purpose, [[Strongly Typed]], [[Functional]] [[Programming Language]]. In addition to strong typing it is also [[Statically Typed]]. It is [[Lazily Evaluated]] and enforces [[Immutable Data Structures]]. The [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler]] is the primary compiler for **Haskell** code.

Here's an example of **Haskell** code:

```haskell
module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
```
