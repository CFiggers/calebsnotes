### What is Airtable?

**Airtable** is an online hybrid spreadsheet/database application. It provides a customizable user interface for organizing, storing, and accessing data without needing to know or use code. I use it to track all of my [[seminary]] classes, class assignments, and the time I spend on each one. I also use it to keep a detailed record of how much money I spend on bills and vehicle costs (like maintenance and gas).

**Airtable** has a flexible application programming interface (or "API") that allows automated connections with other tools, such as [[Power BI]]. This means you can create [[Data Visualizations]] from the information stored there.
