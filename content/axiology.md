### What is Axiology?

The word "**Philosophy**" comes from [[Greek]]:

- ἄξιος ("axios") = "worthy"
- λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Axio**" + "**logy**" literally means "Words about what is Worthy." Another way to phrase it is, "The Study of [[The Good]]."

Broadly, **Axiology** has two major branches:

- [[Ethics]] - The study of human behavior (i.e. Right and Wrong)
- [[Aesthetics]] - The study of beauty in nature and art (i.e. Desirable and Undesirable)

Positions held or rejected under **Axiology** can affect the following topics in [[Applied Philosophy]]:

- Ethics
  - [[Philosophy of Law]]
  - [[Politics]]
- Aesthetics
  - [[Philosophy of Art]]
