### What is Calvinism?

**Calvinism** is a [[Christian]] theological system and a major branch of the [[Protestant]] tradition. It emphasizes the [[Sovereignty of God]], even in matters of [[Salvation]]. I believe that the [core tenets](/tulip) of **Calvinism** accurately represent the teachings of [[The Bible]].
