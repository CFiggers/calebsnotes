### What is Clockify?

Clockify is a web-based timekeeping application. I use it to keep track of the time I spend on homework assignments on a daily and weekly basis. There are many alternatives, but I like and use Clockify because:

- It's Free
- It is cross-platform (web interface, iOS and Android applications)
- It hits a complexity/flexibility/simplicity sweet spot for my use case
