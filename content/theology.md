### What is Theology?

**Theology** is the spiritual and academic study of [[God]] and what he communicates to humanity (this is called [[Revelation]]).

- Θεός ("theos") = "God"
- λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Theo**" + "**logy**" literally means "Words of God." This way of phrasing it contains an intentional double meaning: "Words _of_ God" can mean "words about God," as in what we have to say and understand _about God._ It can also mean "words _from_ God," as in what God has to say and what we can therefore understand _about everything else._

I think of **Theology** as the starting place where all other understanding begins (but not everyone would agree with that).

It can be helpful (if not always perfectly accurate) to think of **Theology** as a tree with branches. Different people group the branches of **Theology** differently (and that's ok&mdash;see the section at the bottom of this page). I like to think of **Theology** as having the following branches:

Of God:

- [[Theology Proper]] - The study of God himself.
- [[Christology]] - The study of [[Jesus Christ]]
- [[Pneumatology]] - The study of [[The Holy Spirit]]

Of God's other [[Revelation]]:

- [[Ktisiology]] - The study of what God reveals about [[Creation]]
- [[Hamartiology]] - The study of what God reveals about [[Sin]]
- [[Soteriology]] - The study of what God reveals about his plan for [[Redemption]]
- [[Ecclesiology]] - The study of what God reveals about his Church
- [[Eschatology]] - The study of what God reveals about the way the story ends

Of Application:

- [[Practical Theology]] - The study of using **Theology** in real life and in other fields of study (like [[Philosophy]])
- [[Divinities]] - The academic studies of theological topics and the Bible
