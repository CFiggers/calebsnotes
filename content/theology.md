### What is Theology?

**Theology** is the spiritual and academic study of [[God]] and what he communicates to humanity (this is called [[Revelation]]).

- Θεός ("theos") = "God"
- λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Theo**" + "**logy**" literally means "Words of God." This way of phrasing it contains an intentional double meaning: "Words _of_ God" can mean "words about God," as in what we have to say and understand _about God._ It can also mean "words _from_ God," as in what God has to say and what we can therefore understand _about everything else._

I think of **Theology** as the starting place where all other understanding begins (but not everyone would agree with that).

It can be helpful (if not always perfectly accurate) to think of **Theology** as a tree with branches. Different people group the branches of **Theology** differently (and that's ok&mdash;see the section at the bottom of this page). I like to think of **Theology** as having the following branches:

Of God:

- [[Theology Proper]] - The study of God himself.
- [[Christology]] - The study of [[Jesus Christ]]
- [[Pneumatology]] - The study of [[The Holy Spirit]]

Of God's other [[Revelation]]:

- [[Ktisiology]] - The study of what God reveals about [[Creation]]
- [[Hamartiology]] - The study of what God reveals about [[Sin]]
- [[Soteriology]] - The study of what God reveals about his plan for [[Redemption]]
- [[Ecclesiology]] - The study of what God reveals about his Church
- [[Eschatology]] - The study of what God reveals about the way the story ends

Of Application:

- [[Practical Theology]] - The study of using **Theology** in real life and in other fields of study (like [[Philosophy]])
- [[Divinities]] - The academic studies of theological topics and the Bible

### Are "Theology" and "Doctrine" different?

Yes. Many Doctrines (like [[Calvinism]] or [[Doctrine of the Trinity]]) are simply collections of multiple [[positions]] within various branches of **Theology**. Having the one word makes it easier to refer to each of the parts together as a unit.

Here's some (oversimplified) examples:

- [[Calvinism]]
  - [[Theology Proper]]: [[God]] is [perfectly sovereign](/sovereignty-of-god)<!-- [[Sovereignty of God]] --> over everything in creation and [completely free](/freedom-of-god)<!-- [[Freedom of God]] --> to manifest [his glory](/the-glory-of-god)<!-- [[The Glory of God]] --> as he sees fit.
  - [[Hamartiology]]: Mankind is [totally depraved](/total-depravity)<!-- [[Total Depravity]] -->, meaning we can't do anything good, even [trust God](/faith)<!-- [[Faith]] -->.
  - [[Soteriology]]: [[God]] chooses to save some sinners, and [he freely chooses whom he will save](/unconditional-election)<!-- [[Unconditional Election]] -->. [Not everyone](/limited-atonement)<!-- [[Limited Atonement]] --> is covered by [Jesus' atoning sacrifice](/the-crucifixion)<!-- [[The Crucifixion]] -->, but those who are will [certainly believe](/irresistable-grace)<!-- [[Irresistable Grace]] --> and be [saved to the very end](/perseverence-of-the-saints)<!-- [[Perseverence of the Saints]] -->.
- [[Protestantism]]
  - [[Ecclesiology]]: [[God]] has made those whom he saves into a [[Priesthood of All Believers]], none of whom is qualitatively superior to any other. [[Jesus Christ]] alone is the head of [his church](/the-church)<!-- [[The Church]] -->, not any human pope or ruling caste of human priests.

### Theology Words

At the end of the day, "label" words like "[[Justification]]" are **made up.** [[Theologians]] have written in dozens of languages for thousands of years, and there is no single "correct" set of terms to use when talking about theological ideas.

**This is ok!** [[The Bible]]'s words were [inspired](/inspiration)<!-- [[Inspiration]] --> in their original form by [[The Holy Spirit]], so we can trust those ones to be much more reliable. But [[All truth is God's truth]], no matter what terms it is expressed in. [Merely human](/creaturely-limitation)<!-- [[Creaturely Limitation]] --> words that try to synthesize and apply [biblical truth](/revelation)<!-- [[Revelation]] -->, like any words humans write without [God's special help](/inspiration)<!-- [[Inspiration]] -->, are limited and imperfect.

Not everyone separates "Theology" into the same categories I have above. That's ok. Not everyone would agree with my super-brief summaries of [[Calvinism]] and [[Protestantism]] above. That's also ok. Theology is a [human](/creaturely-limitation)<!-- [[Creaturely Limitation]] --> endeavor to understand [[God]] and his [revealed truth](/revelation)<!-- [[Revelation]] --> more fully. It isn't possible for [merely human](/creaturely-limitation)<!-- [[Creaturely Limitation]] --> beings like us to do that perfectly. [But it's still worth working on!](/-anything-worth-doing-is-worth-doing-badly)<!-- [["Anything worth doing is worth doing badly."]] --> [[Imperfect things can still be useful and valuable.]]

At the end of the day, it is [[God]] himself, by [[The Holy Spirit]], who [makes it possible for us to understand anything at all](/illumination)<!-- [[Illumination]] -->. Imperfect words, ideas, and understanding (which we will always have, [forever](/heaven)<!-- [[Heaven]] -->!) aren't enough to stop God from helping us know true truth about him, [if that's what he is pleased to do](/illumination)<!-- [[Illumination]] -->.
