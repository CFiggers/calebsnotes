### What is Category Theory?

**Category Theory** is an _extremely_ abstract branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" target="_blank">Mathematics</a>.

Most branches of math (like Arithmetic, Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, etc.) use symbols (like numbers) to represent things. They then use those representations to calculate stuff, prove or disprove hypotheses, or make predictions.

**Category Theory** is a bit different from most math. **Category Theory** about _symbolic representation itself._ It is about rigorously examining the relationships between things. It is about how small stuff combines together into bigger stuff (the technical term for this is [[Composition]].)

I have found **Category Theory** a useful framework for thinking about many abstract and hard-to-test subjects (like [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]]).
