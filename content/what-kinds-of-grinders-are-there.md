title: What Kinds of Grinders Are There?

Coffee grinders basically come in three types:

- Spinning Blade Grinders
- Hand-Held Burr Grinders
- Electric Burr Grinders

### Spinning Blade Grinders

**Spinning blade grinders** are common and inexpensive, but the grounds they produce are really inconsistent. This is because they essentially work by "pulverizing" the coffee beans, producing a wide spread from "fine" to "coarse" in the final grind. There isn't a way to control consistency with a spinning blade grinder&mdash;no matter how nice it is. I don't recommend spinning blade grinders for most people trying to make good coffee at home.

### Hand-Held Burr Grinders

Burr grinders are generally much more consistent than spinning-blade grinders. Some burr grinders are hand-held and human powered. These **Hand-held burr grinders** tend to produce high-quality grinds (compared to spinning blades) and are comparatively inexpensive (compared to electric burrs), but are slow and high-effort, because you have to crank them yourself.

### Electric Burr Grinders

<!-- prettier-ignore -->**Electric burr grinders** are consistent and quick (generally speaking), but tend to be expensive (and sometimes really noisy). A quality electric burr grinder will _start_ around $150 and go up from there, especially the more special features come baked in.
