### What is Knowledge Management?

**Knowledge Management** is the [[Activity]] of collecting, organizing, and storing [[Information]], in order to promote the [[Usefulness]] of that [[Information]]. **Knowledge Management** is a type of [[Knowledge Work]].

In practice, it's difficult (maybe impossible?) to do **Knowledge Management** without doing [[Content Managment]] somewhere along the way.

**Knowledge Management** is itself a broad category with many sub-domains:

- [[Organizational Knowledge Management]]
- [[Personal Knowledge Management]]
- [[Task]] and [[Project Management]]

**Knowledge Management** principles are broadly applicable to a wide range of [[Human Enterprise]], because just about everything that [[People]] get up to has informational components involved.
