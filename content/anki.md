### What is Anki?

**Anki** is a computer program (and web/iOS/Android App) for doing [[Spaced Repetition]]. This type of software is called [[Spaced Repetition Software]]. I use it for memorizing [[Hebrew]] and [[Greek]] vocabulary words and grammar flashcards.

The Android and PC/Mac apps are free to download and use. The iOS app is paid only, and is the main source of income that the developer uses to support himself.
