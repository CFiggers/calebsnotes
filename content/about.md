Hi, I'm [[Caleb]] ðŸ‘‹

Here's some stuff I like to [[think]] and [[write]] about:

- [[Category Theory]]
- [[Programming]]
- [[Theology]]
- [[Philosophy]]
- [[Surviving Seminary]]

Here's some [[hobbies]] and some [[media]] that I enjoy.

This site is meant to be a free-roaming, semi-rigorous exploration of [[Life, the Universe, and Everything]]. It is mostly for my own benefit, but also I would love to find out that it has helped someone else in some way. I embrace the <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=Work_with_the_garage_door_up" target="_blank">Work with the garage door up</a> ethos of [[Robin Sloan]] and [[Andy Matsuchak]] (upon whose "working notes" <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes" target="_blank">website</a> this far simpler [[imitation]] is based).
