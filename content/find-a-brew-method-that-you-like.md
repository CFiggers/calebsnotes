### Why try different brew methods?

You should try different brew methods for a few reasons:

1. Every brew method tastes slightly different.
2. Each brew method has advantages and disadvantages&mdash;so find the one that works best for your setup.
3. Trying different styles of brewing coffee is tons of fun!

### What brewing methods are there?

As mentioned on the [[Tailor Your Coffee Recipe]] page, there are two basic brew methods: **percolation** and **immersion**.

_Percolation_ includes any brewing method where the grounds stay in one place and the water runs through the grounds throughout the brew. _Immersion_ means any brewing method where the grounds and the water hang out together for a while before you separate them.

Here's some examples of each:

- Percolation
  - Most simple electric coffee makers
  - Pour-over
  - Espresso (technically&mdash;espresso is complicated and kindof its own thing!)
  - Most pod-based single-serve coffee makers (like Keurig and Nespresso)
- Immersion
  - French Press
  - AeroPress
  - Clever Dripper
  - Cold Brew
