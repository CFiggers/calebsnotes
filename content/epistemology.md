### What is Epistemology?

The word "**Philosophy**" comes from [[Greek]]:

- ἐπιστήμη ("episteme") = "knowledge"
- λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Epistem**" + "**ology**" literally means "Words about Knowledge." **Epistemology** encompasses what knowledge is, whether and how humans can interact with knowledge, and systems of organizing knowledge so that humans can make use of it.

**Epistemology** relates to [[Metaphysics]] because reality (i.e. what truly exists) and what/how one knows about that reality are closely related questions.

**Epistemology** relates to [[Logic]] because knowledge plays an essential role in [[Reason]].

Topics in **Epistemology**:

- [[The Nature of Knowledge]]
- [[Metacognition]]

Positions held or rejected under **Epistemology** can affect the following topics in [[Applied Philosophy]]:

- [[Philosophy of Education]]
- [[Philosophy of Law]]
- [[Philosophy of Science]]
